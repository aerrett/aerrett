 Hi, Iâ€™m @aerrett, or Alex :)
  I am currently a Computer Science student at Colorado State University. I am interested in AI and machine Learning but I am a long ways off from implementing it. 
  Right now I like to work on small personal projects to accomplish things that affect my own daily life. 
  Nothing too spectactular, but I enjoy working to improve my skills and confidence.

Feel free to reach out at ajehockey@hotmail.com if you have any questions or suggestions.
